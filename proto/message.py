        In protocol buffers, the presence of a field on a message is

        For primitives, a value of the correct type will always be returned
        (the "falsy" values in protocol buffers consistently match those
        in Python). For repeated fields, the falsy value is always an empty
        sequence.

        For messages, protocol buffers does distinguish between an empty
        message and absence, but this distinction is subtle and rarely
        relevant. Therefore, this method always returns an empty message

        In most cases, this method will return True when ``__getitem__``
        would return a truthy value and False when it would return a falsy
        value, so explicitly calling this is not useful.

        The exception case is empty messages explicitly set on the wire,
        which are falsy from ``__getitem__``. This method allows to
        distinguish between an explcitly provided empty message and the
        absence of that meessage, which is useful in some edge cases.

        The most common edge case is the use of ``google.protobuf.BoolValue``
        to get a boolean that distinguishes between ``False`` and ``None``
        (or the same for a string, int, etc.). This library transparently
        handles that case for you, but this method remains available to
        accomodate cases not automatically covered.

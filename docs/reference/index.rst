Below is a reference for the major classes and functions within this
module.

It is split into two main sections:

- The :doc:`message` section (which uses the ``message`` and ``fields``
  modules) handles constructing messages.
- The :doc:`marshal` module handles translating between internal protocol
  buffer instances and idiomatic equivalents.

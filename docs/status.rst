Features and Limitations
------------------------

Nice things this library does:

- Idiomatic protocol buffer message representation and usage.
- Wraps the official protocol buffers implementation, and exposes its objects
  in the public API so that they are available where needed.


Upcoming work
-------------

- Improved enum support.
- Specialized behavior for ``google.protobuf.Value`` and
  ``google.protobuf.Struct`` objects.
- Specialized behavior for ``google.protobuf.FieldMask`` objects.

Messages
========

The fundamental building block in protocol buffers are `messages`_.
Messages are essentially permissive, strongly-typed structs (dictionaries),
which have zero or more fields that may themselves contain primitives or
other messages.

.. code-block:: protobuf

  syntax = "proto3";

  message Song {
    Composer composer = 1;
    string title = 2;
    string lyrics = 3;
    int32 year = 4;
  }

  message Composer {
    string given_name = 1;
    string family_name = 2;
  }

The most common use case for protocol buffers is to write a ``.proto`` file,
and then use the protocol buffer compiler to generate code for it.


Declaring messages
------------------

However, it is possible to declare messages directly.
This is the equivalent message declaration in Python, using this library:

.. code-block:: python

    import proto

    class Composer(proto.Message):
        given_name = proto.Field(proto.STRING, number=1)
        family_name = proto.Field(proto.STRING, number=2)

    class Song(proto.Message):
        composer = proto.Field(Composer, number=1)
        title = proto.Field(proto.STRING, number=2)
        lyrics = proto.Field(proto.STRING, number=3)
        year = proto.Field(proto.INT32, number=4)

A few things to note:

* This library only handles proto3.
* The ``number`` is really a field ID. It is *not* a value of any kind.
* All fields are optional (as is always the case in proto3).
  The only general way to determine whether a field was explicitly set to its
  falsy value or not set all is to mark it ``optional``.
* Because all fields are optional, it is the responsibility of application logic
  to determine whether a necessary field has been set.

Messages are fundamentally made up of :doc:`fields`. Most messages are nothing
more than a name and their set of fields.


Usage
-----

Instantiate messages using either keyword arguments or a :class:`dict`
(and mix and matching is acceptable):

.. code-block:: python

    >>> song = Song(
    ...     composer={'given_name': 'Johann', 'family_name': 'Pachelbel'},
    ...     title='Canon in D',
    ...     year=1680,
    ... )
    >>> song.composer.family_name
    'Pachelbel'
    >>> song.title
    'Canon in D'


Assigning to Fields
-------------------

One of the goals of proto-plus is to make protobufs feel as much like regular python
objects as possible. It is possible to update a message's field by assigning to it,
just as if it were a regular python object.

.. code-block:: python

   song = Song()
   song.composer = Composer(given_name="Johann", family_name="Bach")

   # Can also assign from a dictionary as a convenience.
   song.composer = {"given_name": "Claude", "family_name": "Debussy"}

   # Repeated fields can also be assigned
   class Album(proto.Message):
       songs = proto.RepeatedField(Song, number=1)

   a = Album()
   songs = [Song(title="Canon in D"), Song(title="Little Fugue")]
   a.songs = songs

.. note::

   Assigning to a proto-plus message field works by making copies, not by updating references.
   This is necessary because of memory layout requirements of protocol buffers.
   These memory constraints are maintained by the protocol buffers runtime.
   This behavior can be surprising under certain circumstances, e.g. trying to save
   an alias to a nested field.

   :class:`proto.Message` defines a helper message, :meth:`~.Message.copy_from` to
   help make the distinction clear when reading code.
   The semantics of :meth:`~.Message.copy_from` are identical to the field assignment behavior described above.

   .. code-block:: python

      composer = Composer(given_name="Johann", family_name="Bach")
      song = Song(title="Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor", composer=composer)
      composer.given_name = "Wilhelm"

      # 'composer' is NOT a reference to song.composer
      assert song.composer.given_name == "Johann"

      # We CAN update the song's composer by assignment.
      song.composer = composer
      composer.given_name = "Carl"

      # 'composer' is STILL not a referene to song.composer.
      assert song.composer.given_name == "Wilhelm"

      # It does work in reverse, though,
      # if we want a reference we can access then update.
      composer = song.composer
      composer.given_name = "Gottfried"

      assert song.composer.given_name == "Gottfried"

      # We can use 'copy_from' if we're concerned that the code
      # implies that assignment involves references.
      composer = Composer(given_name="Elisabeth", family_name="Bach")
      # We could also do Message.copy_from(song.composer, composer) instead.
      Composer.copy_from(song.composer, composer)

      assert song.composer.given_name == "Elisabeth"


Enums
-----

Enums are also supported:

.. code-block:: python

    import proto

    class Genre(proto.Enum):
        GENRE_UNSPECIFIED = 0
        CLASSICAL = 1
        JAZZ = 2
        ROCK = 3

    class Composer(proto.Message):
        given_name = proto.Field(proto.STRING, number=1)
        family_name = proto.Field(proto.STRING, number=2)

    class Song(proto.Message):
        composer = proto.Field(Composer, number=1)
        title = proto.Field(proto.STRING, number=2)
        lyrics = proto.Field(proto.STRING, number=3)
        year = proto.Field(proto.INT32, number=4)
        genre = proto.Field(Genre, number=5)

All enums **must** begin with a ``0`` value, which is always the default in
proto3 (and, as above, indistuiguishable from unset).

Enums utilize Python :class:`enum.IntEnum` under the hood:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> song = Song(
    ...     composer={'given_name': 'Johann', 'family_name': 'Pachelbel'},
    ...     title='Canon in D',
    ...     year=1680,
    ...     genre=Genre.CLASSICAL,
    ... )
    >>> song.genre
    <Genre.CLASSICAL: 1>
    >>> song.genre.name
    'CLASSICAL'
    >>> song.genre.value
    1

Additionally, it is possible to provide strings or plain integers:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> song.genre = 2
    >>> song.genre
    <Genre.JAZZ: 2>
    >>> song.genre = 'CLASSICAL'
    <Genre.CLASSICAL: 1>

Serialization
-------------

Serialization and deserialization is available through the
:meth:`~.Message.serialize` and :meth:`~.Message.deserialize` class methods.

The :meth:`~.Message.serialize` method is available on the message *classes*
only, and accepts an instance:

.. code-block:: python

    serialized_song = Song.serialize(song)

The :meth:`~.Message.deserialize` method accepts a :class:`bytes`, and
returns an instance of the message:

.. code-block:: python

    song = Song.deserialize(serialized_song)

JSON serialization and deserialization are also available from message *classes*
via the :meth:`~.Message.to_json` and :meth:`~.Message.from_json` methods.

.. code-block:: python

    json = Song.to_json(song)

    new_song = Song.from_json(json)

Similarly, messages can be converted into dictionaries via the
:meth:`~.Message.to_dict` helper method.
There is no :meth:`~.Message.from_dict` method because the Message constructor
already allows construction from mapping types.

.. code-block:: python

   song_dict = Song.to_dict(song)

   new_song = Song(song_dict)

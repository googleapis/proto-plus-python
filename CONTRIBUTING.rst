Contributor License Agreements
------------------------------

Before we can accept your pull requests, you will need to sign a Contributor
License Agreement (CLA):

- **If you are an individual writing original source code** and **you own the
  intellectual property**, then you'll need to sign an
  `individual CLA <https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual>`__.
- **If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work**,
  then you'll need to sign a
  `corporate CLA <https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate>`__.

You can sign these electronically (just scroll to the bottom). After that,
we'll be able to accept your pull requests.
